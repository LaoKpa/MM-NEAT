As described in the consent form, you'll be playing three dungeons and taking a survey after each. If at any point you have questions, please ask. You will move your character around the dungeon with the arrow keys. You can attack enemies with the arrow keys as well. Simply move toward them when adjacent. However, enemies will fight back, and they also have the ability to attack you from diagonal positions. The only other key you will need is b to place a bomb, assuming you have any. Defeated enemies will sometimes drop bombs. Bombs are primarily used to open up hidden passages by placing them on walls, though not all walls have hidden passages. Use the map at the top of the screen to guide you. These game features and others are summarized in the text at the bottom of the play screen, which you will see shortly. Note that you have limited health and can die. Each time you die you will restart the level, but your health will be higher and the chance that enemies will drop health replenishing power-ups will be higher. Please keep attempting to beat the level until you succeed, but ask for help if you feel stuck.

[In terms of the kind of help we can offer. It is ok to give suggestions about what walls to bomb, or to describe how to move to defeat enemies without being hit. It is not ok to take control of the game and play for them. Hopefully, everyone will be willing to play through each level to the end. If not, then we can obviously let them leave, but we cannot use their survey data and they do not receive the participation incentive. For any data generated from their incomplete session, find the appropriate subject subdirectory and rename it with the prefix "QUIT" so that it is distinguished from the actual data, and so that another subdirectory with that subject ID can be created later.]
